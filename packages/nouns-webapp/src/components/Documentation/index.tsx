              Bowler Nouns is an experiment in funding a game development studio with a DAO.
              Projects such as {nounsLink} have attempted to bootstrap identity, community, governance, and a treasury for the community.
              Bowler Nouns seeks to bootstrap a game studio, a bowling community, and a treasury to fund proposals related to bowling culture.

                  The Bowler Nouns Auction Contract will act as a self-sufficient NFT generation and

                  auction proceeds (ETH) are automatically deposited in the Bowler DAO treasury,
                  where they are governed by Bowler Noun owners. 50% of auction proceeds (ETH) are
                  sent to the game studio multi-sig to fund gaming operations.

                Bowler DAO utilizes a fork of {compoundGovLink} and is the main governing body of
                the Bowler Nouns ecosystem. The Bowler DAO treasury receives 50% of ETH proceeds
                from daily Bowler Noun auctions. Each Bowler Noun is an irrevocable member of Bowler
                DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters. Votes are non-transferable
                (if you sell your Bowler Noun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means
                you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your Bowler Noun.

                  Bowler Nouns are stored directly on Ethereum and do not utilize pointers to other
                  networks such as IPFS. This is possible because Bowler Noun parts are compressed
                  and stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of
                  lossless compression.

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG
                  image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate
                  format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain
                  string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base64
                  encoded.

                  Because 50% of Bowler Noun auction proceeds are sent to the DAO treasury, Founders
                  have chosen to compensate themselves with Bowler Nouns. Every 10th Bowler Noun for
                  the first 15 years of the project (Bowler Noun ids #0, #10, #20, #30 and so on)
                  will be automatically sent to the Founder's multisig to be vested and shared among

                  To encourage proliferation of Bowler Nouns, Founders have chosen to reserve one
                  Bowler Noun per week for prizes. Every 10th Bowler Noun for the first 15 years of
                  the project (Bowler Noun ids #1, #11, #21, #31 and so on) will be automatically
                  sent to the Prizekeeper's multisig to be given out as prizes to outstanding people.

                  Founder and Prize distributions don't interfere with the cadence of 12 hour
                  auctions. Bowler Nouns are sent directly to the Founder's and Prizekeeper's
                  multisigs, and auctions continue on schedule with the next Bowler Noun ID.
